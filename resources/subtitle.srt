1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,100
Oh, look!

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,500
- It's Buffy and all her friends.
- That's witty.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,700
Ever wonder why nobody cool
hangs out with you?

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Just thankful.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,500
Were you this popular at your old school
before you got kicked out?

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,600
Careful. She might beat you up.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Hey!

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,000
- Buffy!
- You missed it!

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,800
- Missed what?
- We saw the zebras mating! Very exciting!

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,100
It was like the Heimlich with stripes!

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,000
And I missed it. Yet somehow
I'll find the courage to live on.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,300
- Where were you?
- Looking at the fishes.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,000
- Was it cool?
- It was fishes.

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,200
I'm feeling you're not in the field-trip spirit.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,400
Well, it was...

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,600
It's nothing. We did the same zoo trip
at my old school every year.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,800
Same old same old.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,600
This isn'tjust about looking at some animals.
This is about not being in class.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,200
You're right. Suddenly the animals
look shiny and new.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,500
Gotta have perspective.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,100
Lance!

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,100
- How's it going?
- Hey, Kyle.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,000
So, is this like a, uh, family reunion?

24
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,900
- No.
- I think it's a family reunion. It's so

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
touching. Doesn't anybody have a camera?

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,400
Does your mom pick out your lice,
or can you do that yourself now?

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Quit it.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,300
Hey! Guys, come on!

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,200
- It's got my notes in there!
- What's going on here?

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,600
I've had it up to here with you four.

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,400
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Did I ask you to speak?

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,600
OK, I guess I did.
But I want the truth. Lance?

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,300
They weren't doing anything.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,300
Really. We were just playing around.

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,500
All right.

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,100
I'll be watching you.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,100
You

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
came through big time.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Way to go, Lance!

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,200
He's been looking for a reason
to come down on us.

42
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,000
- It's OK.
- Let's check out the hyena house.

43
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,400
- But I think it's off limits.
- And therein, my friend, lies the fun.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What are Kyle and his buds
doing with Lance?

45
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,700
Playing with him as a cat plays with a mouse.

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
- What is it with them?
- They're obnoxious. Professionally.

47
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,600
Every school has 'em.

48
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,100
You start a new school, you get your desks,
some blackboards and some mean kids.

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,700
- I'd better track Lance...
- I'll handle it.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,600
This job doesn't require actual slaying.

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,700
You don't think we should follow?

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Kyle and those guys are jerks,
but they're all talk.

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,000
- Mostly.
- Why don't we...?

54
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Yeah, why don't we.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,000
Hold it, hold it.
Are you blind orjust illiterate?

56
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,000
- Hyenas are quick to prey on the weak.
- We were just...

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,500
You're not going in.
Anyone that does is in a world of trouble.

58
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
No. No one's going in there.

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,900
Why is it off limits?

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,800
It's a quarantine. These hyenas
just came in from Africa, so keep out.

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,200
- Even if they call your name.
- What are you talking about?

62
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,500
A Masai tribesman told me that hyenas
are able to understand human speech.

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,800
They follow humans around by day,
learning their names.

64
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,800
At night, when the campfire dies,
they call out to a person.

65
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,500
And once they separate

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,500
the pack devours them.

67
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,900
Cool!

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I don't see any hyenas.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,400
OK. Now we've seen it.

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
- It looks cute.
- I think it looks hungry.

71
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
- Come on, Spot! Suppertime!
- Stop... Guys...

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
Stop! It's not funny!

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,700
Stop it! It's not funny!

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,300
- Pick on someone your own species.
- Are you gonna get in my face?

75
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,300
I thought Xander would be here by now.

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,000
That'd make him on time.
We couldn't have that.

77
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,200
Did he seem upset at all
on the bus back from the zoo?

78
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,600
About what?

79
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,900
I don't know. He was quiet.

80
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
I didn't notice anything.

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,800
But then again, I'm not as hyper-aware
of him as, say, for example, you.

82
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Hyper-aware?

83
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,300
I'm not constantly monitoring his health,
his moods, his blood pressure.

84
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
130 over 80.

85
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
You got it bad, girl.

86
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,200
He makes my head go tingly.
You know what I mean?

87
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,300
- I dimly recall.
- But it hasn't happened to you lately?

88
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,600
Not of late.

89
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,100
Not even for a dangerous
and mysterious older man

90
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,800
whose leatherjacket you're wearing?

91
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,000
- It goes with the shoes.
- Come on!

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,100
Angel pushes your buttons.
You know he does.

93
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,100
I suppose some girls
might find him good-Iooking.

94
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,200
If they have eyes.
All right, he's a honey, but

95
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,900
it's just he's never around, and,

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,800
when he is, all he wants to do
is talk about vampires and I...

97
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,300
- I can't have a relationship...
- There he is!

98
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,600
- Angel?
- Xander.

99
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
- Girls!
- Boy!

100
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
Sorry I'm late. I just forgot
that we were gonna be here.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,200
- Hungry!
- Still want help with geometry tomorrow?

102
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,300
We can work after class.

103
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Yeah. What is this crap?

104
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,500
- Well, it was my buttery croissant.
- Man, I need some food. Birds live on this.

105
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,300
What?

106
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
- What's up with you?
- Is something wrong?

107
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,300
- Did I do something?
- What could you possibly do?

108
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,600
That's crazy talk. I'm just... restless.

109
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,600
- Well, we could go to the ice-cream place.
- I like it here.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,100
- OK, now what?
- You took a bath.

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,700
Yeah. I often do. I'm actually known for it.

112
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,200
That's OK.

113
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,800
And the weird-behaviour award goes to...?

114
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,800
Oh, great! It's the winged monkeys.

115
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,300
You know, I don't understand
why you're sitting at our table.

116
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,700
Shouldn't you be hovering over the football
stadium with Goodyear written on you?

117
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,800
The kid's fat!

118
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Right! That's enough training for one day.

119
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,700
That last round was sloppy.
Want to do it again?

120
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
No! No, no, that's fine.

121
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
You just run along to class.

122
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,800
While I wait for the feeling
to return to my arms.

123
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,600
Oh, my God!

124
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,900
Look out!

125
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Stop! Whoa! Get it! Get it!

126
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Lordy, Herbert!
Gave Mr Flutie quite a scare, didn't he?

127
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,400
Students, I'd like you all to meet Herbert,

128
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,400
our new mascot
for the Sunnydale High Razorbacks!

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,200
- He's so cute!
- He's not cute! No! He's a fierce razorback!

130
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,100
- He doesn't look mean, Mr Flutie.
- He's mean. He's ready for action, see?

131
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,400
Here are the tusks... A scary razorback.

132
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,000
You're right. He's a fine mascot
and will engender school spirit.

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,300
He'd better. Costs a fortune to feed him.
All right, let's get you back into your cage.

134
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
This way.

135
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,600
- I'm not getting this.
- It's simple, really.

136
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,800
The bisector of a vertex

137
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,900
is the line that divides the angle
at that vertex into two equal parts.

138
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,300
It's a big blur, these numbers and angles.

139
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,800
It's the same stuff from last week.

140
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
- Why do I need to learn this?
- Because otherwise you'll flunk math.

141
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,700
Explain why that's bad.

142
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,800
You fail math, you flunk out of school,

143
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,300
you end up being the guy
at the pizza place that says:

144
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
"Hey, kids, where's
the cool parties this weekend?"

145
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,300
We've been through this.
Do you have a headache?

146
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,800
Yeah. And I think I know what's causing it.

147
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,100
Ah! That's better.
It goes right to the source of the pain.

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
- Xander...
- Forget it, OK? I don't get it. I won't ever.

149
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,700
I don't care!

150
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,100
We can finish this another time.

151
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
See, the problem is you kids today
have no school spirit.

152
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,200
Hold on. Let me get his outfit off.

153
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,800
Today it's all gangs and drugs and
those movies on Showtime with the nudity.

154
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,400
I don't have cable. I heard.

155
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,200
At your age, we cared about the school's
reputation and the football team.

156
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,200
Of course, when I was your age,

157
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,100
I had old guys saying how much better
things were when they were my age.

158
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,200
Yeah.

159
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,200
All right... it's raining.

160
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,000
All regular gym classes
have been postponed.

161
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,500
So you know what that means.

162
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Dodge ball.

163
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,500
For those of you that may have forgotten,
the rules are as follows:

164
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,400
You dodge.

165
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,400
- Here we go!
- On your guards!

166
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
God, this game is brutal.

167
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
I love it!

168
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,600
Xander?

169
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
What's wrong with you?

170
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,800
I guess you've noticed
I've been different lately.

171
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
- Yes.
- I think I'm...

172
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I think it's because my feelings for you
have been changing.

173
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,900
And we've been friends
for such a long time

174
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,800
that I feel like I need to tell you something.

175
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I've, um...

176
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,000
I've decided to drop geometry. So I won't
be needing your math help any more.

177
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,200
Which means I won't have to look
at your pasty face again.

178
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
Are you gonna say something to me?

179
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,000
- Dogs.
- Where?

180
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,100
That's no way to play lead guitar!
That's hunt and peck.

181
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,800
It's not!

182
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,400
You heard Wretched Refuse play.
What do you think of the lead?

183
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Hey!

184
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,900
- What are you...?
- Shut up.

185
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
You're sharing.

186
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Friends like to share.

187
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,700
- Good?
- It's too well done.

188
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,800
Hey! That is not cool.

189
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Hey!

190
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Let's do lunch.

191
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,800
I've known him my whole life, Buffy.

192
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,000
We haven't always been close,
but he's never...

193
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,500
I think something's wrong with him.

194
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,400
Or maybe there's something wrong with me.

195
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,600
What are you talking about?

196
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,900
Come on. He's not picking on you.
He's just sniffing you a lot.

197
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,400
I don't know.
Maybe three isn't company any more.

198
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,700
You think this has something to do with me?

199
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
Of course.

200
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,200
No. That doesn't explain why
he's hanging out with the Dode Patrol.

201
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,500
Something's going on. Something weird.

202
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,200
What are you gonna do?

203
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,200
Talk to the expert on weird.

204
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,100
Xander's teasing the less fortunate?

205
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
There's a noticeable change
in clothing and demeanour?

206
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Yes.

207
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,900
All his spare time is spent
lounging about with imbeciles?

208
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,300
- It's bad, isn't it?
- It's devastating.

209
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,900
He's turned into a 16-year-old boy.
You'll have to kill him.

210
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,700
- Giles, I'm serious!
- So am I!

211
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,200
Except for the part about killing him.

212
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,000
Testosterone is a great equaliser.
Turns all men into morons. He'll get over it.

213
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,800
I cannot believe
that you are trying to Scully me!

214
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,300
There is something supernatural at work
here. Get your books! Look stuff up!

215
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Look under what?

216
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't know. That's your department.

217
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,800
The evidence you have is sketchy at best.

218
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,600
He scared the pig.

219
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,200
- Well, he did.
- Buffy, boys can be cruel.

220
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,200
They tease. They prey on the weak.
It's a natural teen behaviour pattern.

221
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,400
What did you just say?

222
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,100
Um... they tease.

223
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,600
They prey on the weak.
I've heard that somewhere before...

224
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,100
Xander has been acting totally wiggy
since we went to the zoo.

225
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,300
Him and Kyle went into the hyena cage.

226
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,200
Oh, God, that laugh.

227
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,800
- You're saying Xander's becoming a hyena?
- I don't know.

228
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,200
Or been possessed by one?
Not just Xander. All of them.

229
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,800
- Well, I've certainly never heard of...
- Herbert! They've found him!

230
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,200
The pig?

231
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,200
Dead. And also eaten.

232
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,900
- Principal Flutie's freaking out.
- Testosterone, huh?

233
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,700
What are you gonna do?

234
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Get my books.

235
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Look stuff up.

236
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,800
You four!

237
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,600
- What?
- Oh, don't think I don't know.

238
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,200
Three kids saw you outside Herbert's room.
You're busted. Yeah. You're going down.

239
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,700
- How is Herbert?
- Crunchy!

240
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,400
That's it! My office! Right now!

241
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
Now!

242
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,600
You'll have so much detention, your
grandchildren will be staying after school!

243
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,200
Wow! Apparently, Noah rejected
the hyenas from the Ark

244
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,100
cos he thought they were an evil,
impure mixture of dogs and cats.

245
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Hyenas aren't well liked.

246
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,500
They do seem to be the schmoes
of the animal kingdom.

247
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,500
Why couldn't Xander be possessed
by a puppy or some ducks?

248
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,700
- Assuming "possession" is the right word.
- I'll say it is.

249
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,800
The Masai of the Serengeti have spoken
of animal possession for generations.

250
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,100
- I should've remembered.
- How does it work?

251
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,200
There's a sect of animal worshippers
known as primals.

252
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,500
They believe that humanity
consciousness the soul

253
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,200
is a perversion, a dilution of spirit.

254
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,400
To them the animal state is holy.

255
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
They're able,
through transpossession, to

256
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,400
draw the spirit of certain animals
into themselves.

257
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,400
Then they act like hyenas?

258
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,600
Only the most predatory of animals are of
interest to primals. So, yes, that would fit.

259
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,200
So, what happens to the person
once the spirit's in them?

260
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,700
If it goes unchecked?

261
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,500
I gotta find Xander.

262
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
They are strong.

263
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
Xander!

264
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
This is ridiculous. We need to talk.

265
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
I've been waiting for you to jump my bones!

266
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,100
I have seen some sick things
in my life, believe me!

267
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,600
But this is beyond the pale!

268
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,600
What is it with you people? Is it drugs?

269
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,800
How could you? A poor, defenceless pig!

270
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,400
What are you doing?

271
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,800
- Get off of me!
- Is that what you really want?

272
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,400
We both know what you really want.
You want danger, don't ya?

273
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,200
- You like your men dangerous.
- You're in trouble.

274
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,800
You are infected with some hyena thing.

275
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,100
Dangerous and mean, right?
Like Angel, your mystery guy.

276
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,200
Well, guess who just got mean.

277
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,800
Now stop that! You're only gonna
make things worse for yourselves.

278
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,400
I am gonna call your parents,
and they're gonna take you all home.

279
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,400
Thank you.

280
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
I'm sorry.

281
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,100
That is it!

282
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,600
Do you know how long I've waited

283
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,200
until you'd stop pretending
that we aren't attracted...

284
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,900
Until Willow stops kidding herself

285
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,500
that I could settle with anyone but you

286
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,300
Xander, I don't wanna hurt you.

287
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,300
Now do you wanna hurt me?

288
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,400
Come on, Slayer. I like it when you're scared.

289
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,000
The more I scare you... the better you smell.

290
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,500
You're about this close to expulsion, people!

291
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,300
But I'm willing to talk to the school
counsellor and we can discuss options.

292
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,800
Get down from there this instant!

293
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,600
Ow!

294
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,700
Are you insane?!

295
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,700
Hurry up! We've got to lock him up
before he comes to.

296
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,400
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- I hit him.

297
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
- With what?
- A desk.

298
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,200
- He tried his hand at felony sexual assault.
- Buffy, the hyena in him didn't...

299
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,100
No.

300
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,100
No. But in his animal state,
his idea of wooing

301
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,000
doesn't involve a Yanni CD
and a bottle of Chianti.

302
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,400
- There. That oughta hold him. Where's Giles?
- At some teachers' meeting.

303
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,300
What are we gonna do?
How do we get Xander back?

304
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,200
I'm more worried about
what the rest of the pack are up to.

305
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:01,300
The rest of the pack was spotted
outside Herbert the mascot's cage.

306
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,000
- They were sent to the principal's office.
- Good. That'll show 'em.

307
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,000
Did it show 'em?

308
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,700
They didn't hurt him, did they?

309
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,600
They, uh... ate him.

310
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,100
They ate Principal Flutie?

311
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,700
Ate him up?

312
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,600
The, uh, official theory is that wild dogs
got into his office somehow.

313
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There was no one at the scene.

314
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,400
But Xander didn't. He was with you.

315
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,600
Oh, well, that's a small mercy.

316
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,800
How do we stop this?
How do you transpossess someone?

317
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm afraid I don't have all the pieces.

318
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,800
Accounts of the primals and
their methods are thin on the ground.

319
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,000
There is some talk of a predatory act,
but the exact ritual is, um...

320
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,400
The Malleus Maleficarum deals in the
particulars of demonic possession, which

321
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
may apply.

322
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,900
Yes. One should be able
to transfer the spirits to another human.

323
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,600
Oh, that's great! Any volunteers?

324
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,800
Oh. Good point.

325
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,800
What we need to do
is put the hyena back in the hyena.

326
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,900
- Until we know more...
- Bet that zookeeper could help.

327
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Maybe he didn't quarantine them
because they were sick.

328
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,200
- We should talk to him.
- OK.

329
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,600
- Oh, wait! Somebody's gotta watch Xander.
- I will.

330
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,600
- Well, are you sure? If he wakes up...
- I'll be all right. Go.

331
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Come on.

332
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,200
Willow.

333
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,800
How are you feeling?

334
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,600
Like somebody hit me with a desk.

335
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,500
- What am I doing here?
- You're resting.

336
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,200
You guys got me locked up now.

337
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,600
Cos you're sick. Buffy said.

338
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Oh, yeah. Buffy and her all-purpose solution.
Punch 'em out, knock 'em down.

339
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
What would she do to somebody really sick?

340
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,800
That's not fair!
Buffy's saved both of our lives.

341
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,700
Before she came, our lives didn't
need that much saving, did they?

342
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,200
Weren't things a lot simpler
when it was just you and me?

343
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,800
- Maybe.
- When we were alone together.

344
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,900
I know there's something wrong with me.
I think it's getting worse.

345
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,200
But I can't stand around waiting for Buffy
to decide it's time to punch me out again.

346
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,500
Look, I want you to help me. I want you.

347
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,300
- I am helping you.
- You're doing what you're told.

348
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,700
Buffy's trying to help you, too.
You know that.

349
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,000
- Or Xander does.
- Yeah.

350
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,600
Buffy's so selfless. Always thinking of us.

351
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,600
If I'm so dangerous,
how come she left you alone with me?

352
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,600
- I told her to.
- Why?

353
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,800
Cos I know you better than she does.

354
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,500
And I wanted to be here to see if
you were still you.

355
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
You know I am.

356
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,100
Look at me.

357
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,600
Look.

358
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Xander...

359
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
Now I know.

360
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,500
Let me out! Let me out!

361
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,900
The students have been possessed?

362
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

363
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,200
- We're really, really sure.
- You don't seem that surprised by this.

364
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,400
They were imported from Africa.
They were strange from day one.

365
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,300
I did some homework.
That particular breed is very rare.

366
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,600
Totally vicious. Historically,
they were worshipped by these guys.

367
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,200
- Primals.
- Yeah. Creepy guys.

368
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,500
They had rituals
for taking the hyena spirits, but

369
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,100
I don't see how that happened to your kids.

370
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,200
We don't know how the ritual works.
Only that it involves, uh,

371
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,300
- a predatory act and some symbol.
- Predatory act?

372
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,500
Of course. That makes sense.
Where did you read that?

373
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
- Sherman Jeffries' work on cults and...
- Boys?

374
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,200
- Sorry.
- Look. Look...

375
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:21,700
We may have enough information so that
we could pull off a reverse transpossession.

376
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,300
What do we do?

377
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,600
Get those possessed students
to the hyena cage right away.

378
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,900
- I'll meet you there. We'll begin the rituals.
- We can guarantee you one,

379
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,600
- but four more are missing.
- Don't worry about that.

380
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,000
After hyenas feed and rest, they will track
the missing member until they find him.

381
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,600
They should come right to you.

382
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Willow!

383
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,900
Willow!

384
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm not listening.

385
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,200
Willow

386
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,400
Willow

387
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,200
Xander shut up!

388
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,900
Willow!

389
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,000
Run!

390
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,700
- I think they're going.
- They could be faking it.

391
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,900
No, they're looking for somebody weak.

392
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,600
I didn't know they'd come after Xander.

393
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,500
- We must lead them back to the zoo.
- And before their next meal.

394
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,200
Individually they're as strong as you.
As a group...

395
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,700
They're tough. But they're getting stupider.
Go to the zoo and I'll bring them to you.

396
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,200
I didn't say she looks better than you.
I said she looks better.

397
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,300
I heard what I heard. Joey, chew.
You have to chew or you'll choke.

398
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,300
I don't see why we have to have
this conversation every time we see them.

399
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
I didn't start it.

400
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,000
Damn!

401
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,900
- Where are the keys?
- Huh?

402
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,500
Joey!

403
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,200
Joey!

404
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
Joey

405
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,600
Get out!

406
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,400
What's going on?
Hey, get off! Get off!

407
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,500
Joey! Joey!

408
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,200
Joey!

409
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,700
Joey!

410
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,300
Didn't your mom teach you?

411
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,800
Don't play with your food.

412
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,500
Come on. You know what you want.

413
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,300
The pathway to the hyena house.

414
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,700
- Where's the zookeeper?
- He must be inside.

415
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,200
I'll go in and prepare things. You just...
warn us when Buffy and the others approach.

416
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,200
Doctor?

417
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,600
Uh... zookeeper?

418
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,100
Oh, of course. The, uh...
Masai ceremonial garb. Yes. Very good.

419
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,000
Are you, uh, otherwise prepared
for the transpossession?

420
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,000
Almost.

421
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,500
Oh, right. The, uh sacred circle.

422
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,100
Yes, you'd need that to, um...

423
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,400
But this would be here
when the children first came.

424
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Why would you?

425
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,900
How terribly frustrating for you,

426
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,600
that schoolchildren could accomplish
what you could not.

427
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,000
It bothered me.

428
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
But the power will be mine.

429
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,400
They're almost here! Giles! Giles!

430
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,700
Where are the hyenas
for the transpossession?

431
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,900
Right here in the feeding area.
Stay back. They haven't been fed.

432
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
- Where's Giles?
- He's... laying in wait.

433
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,200
They're almost here!
Shouldn't you bring the hyenas out?

434
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,600
When the time is right.
I'm gonna need your help.

435
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,800
They're right behind me!

436
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
That's Buffy. Get ready!

437
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,300
- Here.
- What is this?

438
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,200
A predatory act, remember?

439
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,100
Uh, right.
You'll pretend to slash my throat and

440
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,300
- and put the evil in the hyenas?
- Something like that.

441
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,500
Buffy, it's a trap!

442
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
Willow!

443
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,200
Uh... did I miss anything?

444
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,100
The vice principal's taking over
till they find a replacement.

445
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,100
Shouldn't be too hard. Unless they ask
what happened to the last one.

446
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,800
- I had nothing to do with that, right?
- Right.

447
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,100
- You only ate the pig.
- I ate a pig?

448
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,400
Was he cooked and called bacon, or...

449
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Oh, my God! I ate a pig?

450
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,700
- The whole trichinosis issue aside yuck!
- It wasn't really you.

451
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,000
Well, I remember the field trip
and the hyena house.

452
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,400
And next thing, some guy's
holding Willow with a knife.

453
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,200
- You saved my life.
- Hey, nobody messes with my Willow.

454
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,200
This is definitely the superior Xander.
Accept no substitutes.

455
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,700
I didn't do anything else, did l,
around you guys? Anything embarrassing?

456
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,500
Nah!

457
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,100
Not at all.

458
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,500
- We're gonna be late.
- See you at lunch.

459
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Cool!

460
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,200
Oh, hey, going vegetarian, huh?

461
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,100
I've been reading up on animal possession.

462
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,600
I cannot find anything anywhere
about memory loss afterwards.

463
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,400
- Did you tell them that?
- Your secret dies with me.

464
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,000
Shoot me, stuff me, mount me.
